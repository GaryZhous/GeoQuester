# GeoQuester
This is a Geographic Information System (GIS) application developed in C++ for our software design course ECE297. We used GTK graphics library to construct the canvas and those interactive widgets, with geographical data from OpenStreetMap API. Resembling Google Maps, it offers several intriguing features, including:
  * Annotation (We used SQLite to store user's annotation data)
  * Dark Mode Switch
  * Shortest paths finding between intersections with animation (We used A* algorithm to find the shortest paths)

### Traveling Courier Contest
At the end of the course, we were asked to design an effective solution to tackle a variant of TSP (Traveling Salesman Problem). We need to provide a courier with an optimum route to pick up and deliver all the items required starting from a depot and ending at the same depot.

The quality (route travel times) of the routes we found in various tricky test cases will be used in the leaderboard of this contest.
With a solid multi-destination Dijskra's algorithm and a good greedy path reconstruction approach with simulated annealing, our solution ranked #9 among 91 teams.
